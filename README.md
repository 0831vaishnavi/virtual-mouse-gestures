# Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures

## Description
This project focuses on creating a virtual mouse system that utilizes hand gestures for cursor movement and actions like clicks and drags. It eliminates the need for physical devices, offering a hands-free solution for human-computer interaction.

## Workflow
1. **Hand Detection**  
   - Used OpenCV to detect and track hand movements.  
   - Implemented image processing techniques to identify gesture patterns.

2. **Gesture Recognition**  
   - Defined gestures for cursor movement, left click, right click, and scrolling.  
   - Used contour and convex hull analysis for gesture identification.

3. **Cursor Control**  
   - Mapped recognized gestures to mouse actions.  
   - Ensured smooth and responsive cursor movement.

## Steps
1. Capture real-time video feed using a webcam.
2. Detect and process hand movements using OpenCV.
3. Map gestures to predefined mouse actions.
4. Test and fine-tune the system for accuracy and responsiveness.

## Outcome
A fully functional virtual mouse system that provides an intuitive and efficient way to control a computer using hand gestures.
